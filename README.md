## Disease Symptom Prediction:
This project predicts possible diseases based on user provided symptoms using machine learning classification techniques.

## Overview
The system is trained on a disease symptom dataset where symptoms act as input features and diseases are the target labels. Multiple classifiers are implemented to compare prediction accuracy.

## Models and Tools:
Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, K Nearest Neighbors, and SGD Classifier are used.
-Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit learn are the main technologies.

## Note:
This project is strictly for educational purposes and not for medical diagnosis.
